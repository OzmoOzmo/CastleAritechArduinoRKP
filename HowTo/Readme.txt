Note: Updated to Compiles using the latest Arduino IDE 1.6.x from "Arduino.cc"

for the details...


Basically this allows you to access an Aritech Alarm from a mobile phone by emulating one of its keypads using an arduino.


There are two options for the electronics

1. Straight connect TX of Arduino and RX of the Alarm panel - and use a Diode and connect the RX of Arduino to TX of the Alarm panel

2. Connect using a two transistor interface board - connects to 12v ABCD keypad socket



Plans for 1 and 2 are published
